    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup beer</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <h3>Beer Cheese Sauce:</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light beer</li>
        <li>2 cups grated sharp </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour beer, paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and garlic cloves into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the prepared grill until no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make cheese sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; whisk continuously until mixture turns golden and forms a smooth paste. Pour in half and half and beer; stir until mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir in paprika, garlic powder, and ground mustard.</li>
        <li>Toast hamburger buns on the grill until they show grill marks, about 2 minutes. Add your favorite toppings, pour cheese sauce on top, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
